	<h1>1. Renewation of bathroom</h1>
	<p>Bathroom renovations are generally not on the same scale as kitchen renovations, but as they can involve plumbing and render a bathroom unusable during the process, they are major considerations. Bathroom renovations offer the means to increase luxury within a home, and increasingly are done to help a family save water and electricity with green fixtures.</p>

	<br>		
	<h1>2. Renewation of kitchen</h1>
	<p>Renovating the kitchen is the most popular type of major renovation in a home. It’s also the best way to increase a home’s value if it were to be put on the market. Kitchen renovations can be done for numerous reasons – increasing usable space, updating appliances and cabinetry, or they can be done in concert with other renovations.</p>

	<h1>3. Renewation of hall  </h1>
	<p>Here the design has touch from our old classic. The use of wooden furniture’s with the style used by the traditional craftsmen is one of its elements. The style is also known as the old school European style.</p>
	<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Here the interiors include wood paneling and molding with elaboration </li>
			<li>This brings out the beauty of classic European décor </li>
			<li>Antique pieces are used in designing </li>
			<li>The tiles used over here are of velvet or silk touch </li>
			<li>Colors used are sober and classy </li>
			<li>Others... </li>

	<br>		
	<h1>4. Renewation of bedroom </h1>
	<p>Adding a room (or more than one) is also very popular. Often, families with two or more children and not enough bedrooms choose to add on so each child can have their own bedroom. However, adding on can also be done if you want to leave the majority of the home alone, but want to add an office, family game room, sunroom or something else. These are major considerations, as the home’s internal structure will be altered during construction.</p>

	<br>		
	<h1>5. Adding a New Bathroom </h1>
	<p>For homes that have fewer bathrooms than is ideal, adding one is a very popular choice. This might be done to provide a private bathroom for children, or a guest bathroom that is not used by the entire family. However, because of plumbing considerations (and general construction), these are very major undertakings.</p>

	<h1>6. Basement Renovations </h1>
	<p>Finishing a basement is one of the best ways to add usable space to a home in North York. Basements can become full bedroom suites, or they might be used as movie rooms, game rooms, in-law suites or full apartments, depending on the needs. These major renovations can involve an immense amount of work and design, as well.</p>
